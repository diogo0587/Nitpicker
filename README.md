## ✨ Features

*   Browse online albums and file lists

*   Built-in download manager to view caching progress and history
*   Built-in video player with playlist support and state saving

This app was developed based on [bunkr-albums.io](https://bunkr-albums.io). Because of potential copyright risks, I didn't make the downloaded content appear directly in the phone's gallery. However, the app's directory:

`Android/data/com.d3intran.nitpicker/files/Download/`

contains all the downloaded videos. 
Inside the app, you can **long-press** folders to rename them, or create/delete folders to manage videos. You can also enter a folder to select videos and move them elsewhere.

## 🚀 Installation

You can download the latest `app-release.apk` file directly from the **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/d3intran/Nitpicker/releases)** page.

1.  Go to the **[Releases page](https://github.com/d3intran/Nitpicker/releases)**. 
2.  Download the `Nitpicker.apk` file from the latest release. 
3.  On your Android device, you might need to enable "Install from unknown sources" to install the APK.
4.  Locate the downloaded APK file and tap to install.
